                The main goal of our project is to develop a sensor-based system that will allow us to accurately measure different
                water parameters of a tank in order to optimize the growth of the ecosystem within the tank. This would have many
                different applications, including but not limited to agriculture, the aquarium industry, as well as civilian infrastructure.

                For our project, we want to incorporate as many parameters as possible into the system; starting with salinity.
                If budget and time constraints allow, we hope to incorporate measurements of pH, alkalinity, as well as calcium (CA).
                These metrics allow the User to optimize nutrient levels of the ecosystem with a high level of accuracy and to dose
                the water supply accordingly. This information will be available on a digital screen connected directly to the device,
                as well as displayed and cast to a web server.

                Future expansion for this project could begin with the automation of dosing, app integration, and the ability
                to increase the number of sensor inputs.
